# ExplorerRestarter

A simple C# application that monitors for a specific key combination (`Right Ctrl + Question Mark + Enter`) to restart the Windows Explorer process.

## Motivation

This was made entirely because Windows 11 is an unfinished product. I've grown tired of windows going underneath my taskbar and not being able to get it back without restarting the explorer process. This solution is a lot faster and more convenient than the traditional method of opening the task manager and restarting the process from there.

There are other solutions out there that do the same thing, but I wanted to make my own version of it primarily to get back into using C#.
