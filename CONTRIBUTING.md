## <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Guidelines

This repository follows a similar commit style to [Angular's Contribution Guidelines](angular).

Because of this, we have copied, adapted and simplified their contribution guidelines to better fit the needs of this project.

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a prefix (the type) and a suffix (the change):

```
<type>: <change>
```

### Type
Must be one of the following:

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **revert**: If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the hash of the commit being reverted.
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
